Tritris

This is a tetris-like game where each piece has 3 blocks. 
Once the player starts a randomly generated piece will begin to fall.
The user can make the object move right, move left, fall faster or rotate using their computer keys or buttons on the screen. 
Once the piece can no longer move down a new piece will start to fall. 
If the player has made a full row of blocks than row will delete and they will get a point.
When no new pieces can be added to the screen the game is over.
The player will have the option to play again or exit.
The goal of the game is to get as many points possible. 

This game requires that Python and Pygame are installed on your computer.
